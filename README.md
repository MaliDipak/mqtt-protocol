# MQTT Publisher and Subscriber

This repo demonstrates how to publish and subscribe to MQTT topics using Node.js and the `mqtt` library.

## Overview

MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) is a lightweight messaging protocol ideal for IoT (Internet of Things) applications. It follows a publish-subscribe architecture where clients (publishers) send messages to a broker, and other clients (subscribers) receive messages from the broker.

This project provides code examples for both publishing and subscribing to MQTT topics. 

## Features

- **Publishing Data**: You can publish data to an MQTT topic using the provided example.
- **Subscribing to Data**: You can subscribe to an MQTT topic and receive incoming messages.
